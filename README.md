<b>What are we building?</b>

We are building a movie recommendation system for users based on their viewing history and preferences. 

------------- 
<b> What does it do or what kind of problem does it solve?</b>

Lots of us agreed that itâ€™s frustrating when you spend lots of time trying to search for something to watch on the TV. The idea behind this is that it will allow users to input some data into the programme and it will generate a list of recommendations based on the mood of the user.
